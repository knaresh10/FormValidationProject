Project Description:

The goal of this project is to develop a form with essential fields and implement data verification to ensure that the form is filled out by a human and not a bot. The form will include the following required fields: Full Name, Email ID, Phone Number, Password, and Confirm Password. Each field will have specific validation criteria that must be met.

The validation criteria for each field are as follows:
- Full Name must have a minimum length of 5 characters.
- Email ID should contain the "@" character.
- Phone Number should not be "123456789" and must consist of 10 digits.
- Password cannot be "password" or the name of the user, and it should have a minimum length of 8 characters.
- The Password and Confirm Password fields should match.

If any of the validation criteria are not met, an appropriate error message should be displayed, such as "Please enter a correct email" or "The password is not strong enough." While additional conditions and fields can be included for further form validation, the above mentioned criteria are mandatory.

By implementing this form with comprehensive data verification, we ensure that only valid and reliable information is submitted, enhancing the overall user experience and protecting against spam or automated submissions.
